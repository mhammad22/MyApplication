The above image is just for illustration and the display of your app may change, as considered
appropriate, as long as it adheres to the following requirements:
*) Use a List View or Recycler View for displaying chat messages.
*) Use alternative layouts for each row corresponding to the current user (who is using this screen)
and the remote user (with whom chat is being conducted), so that the two users can be
differentiated.
*) When the current user enters a message in the input box and press “Send”, the message shall be
added to the list. For emulating reply from the remote user, generate some random text and add
that to message list, every time the current user sends a message. Take care of ordering of the
messages (based upon timestamp).
